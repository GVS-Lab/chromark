# expansion for the 2d segmentation should be at least 5 * max(protein_expansion) + 2 --> the factor 5 comes
# from z-voxel size ~= 5* x-y_voxel size --> when dilating the nuclear boundary to capture the protein expression
# we dilate protein_expansion-times in z and 5*protein_expansion in x-y direction. 2D segmentation expansion should cover
# expanded nuclei which leads to the above equation
