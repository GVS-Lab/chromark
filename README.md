# System requirements

The code has been developed and executed on a HP Z4 workstation running Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS with a Intel(R)
Xeon(R) W-2255 CPU with 3.70 GHz, 128GB RAM. Note that the code can also be run for machines with less available RAM.

## Installation

To install the code, please clone the repository and install the required software libraries and packages listed in
the **requirements.txt** file:

```
git clone https://github.com/GVS-Lab/immune_cell_project.git
conda create --name icp --file requirements.txt
conda activate icp
```

## Data resouces (Optional)

Intermediate results of the analysis can be obtained from our [Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HszNjSRFI2x25mEDQo-a_rKpemwtJZ4C?usp=sharing) but can also be produced using the steps described below to reproduce the results of the paper. If you want to use and/or adapt the code to run another analysis, the data is not required neither.
